# Express.js Route Handler with Inadequate Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers. The provided code lacks proper error handling for database operations and invalid user IDs, leading to potential crashes and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data based on a provided ID.  However, it lacks robust error handling. If the database query fails or the ID is invalid, the server may crash or respond unexpectedly.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses these issues.  The improved handler includes:

- **Comprehensive error handling for database operations:** Uses try...catch blocks to handle potential exceptions during database interactions.
- **Graceful handling of invalid user IDs:** Checks for invalid input and responds with appropriate error messages. 
- **Centralized error handling middleware:** The solution implements error handling middleware that catches unhandled exceptions and sends appropriate error responses.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Navigate to the directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node bug.js` (for the buggy code)
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` (for the fixed code)
